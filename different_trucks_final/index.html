            <h2>Early Models</h2>
           <h3>Many enthusiasts prefer the classic design of older pickups which 
            exude a sense of the style and charm that might be lacking in more modern models.
            Mechanics like the older trucks more because they are so much simpler to work on! The older trucks were made with better materials so they
            tend to last a lot longer. Now trucks are more expensive and aren't made anywhere near as good.
            they are cheaper upfront and may also have lower insurance costs which is partly due to their lower market value in comparison to newer models.

            <h2>Newest Models</h2>
        <h3>Reliability isn't the only reason to spend your money on a newer 4x4. There are plenty of other compelling factors.
          Modern manufacturing practices have opened the way for hydro-formed frames that are stronger and 
          stiffer than previous designs without adding any weight. Usually you don't see newer trucks broken down on the side of the road. It is usually 
          old rusted trucks. Buying a newer trucks means it will be covered under warranty if something is wrong with it so that is always a plus.
