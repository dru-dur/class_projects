            <h2>First Chevy Truck</h2>
           <h3>
            Chevrolet has been building trucks since 1918. The first chevrolet Truck was the model-T. Chevrolet produced its first truck six years into its history and was inspired by 
            machines used in factories to move materials from station to station. functiobnality was its main focus. The cab and frame were both kept open in order to allow the first 
            vehicle customizations: installing the vehicle body that best fit their needs. If the driver needed the truck for work then he could 
            make it that way. If he had a family he could make it accomodate them instead. I think it was a really smart idea at the time.

            <h2>Newest Chevy Truck</h2>
        <h3>The Chevrolet truck lineup offers a variety of options to meet different driving needs. There are three key models: the Chevrolet Colorado, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, 
            and Chevrolet Silverado HD. Each truck is tailored for specific purposes. When it comes to the new Silverado 1500, advanced truck technology meets legendary pickup capability.
            The silverado HD is a workhorse. It can handle just about any load. There is an EV version for those people who like electric vehicles.
            A good small truck is the Colorado. It is the best of all worlds.
