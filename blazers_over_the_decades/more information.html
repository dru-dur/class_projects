            <h2>Blazers during the 2010's</h2>
            <h3>2009 was the closest they made to 2010 before renaming to trailblazer. The 2009 blazer came with a 4.2-liter inline-6 engine. It also 
                had the option ofa 5.3 liter V8. Both engines came with four-speed automatic transmissions. They had a choice of 2WD or 4WD. The SS model 
                offered rear-wheel drive or a performance tuned all-wheel-drive system. It could seat up to five people and came with plenty of cargo space.
                If you take care of them and keep them maintained they will last according to some owners.
