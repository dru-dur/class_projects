            <h2>Blazers during the 90's</h2>
           <h3>The 1990 blazer was a full-size SUV known for its boxy design, and robust features. The 90's Blazer typically had a 5.7L v8 which
            gave it more than enough power. It had around 210 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque. 4WD was a standard feature for the 90 model making it a good 
            vehicle in case of bad weather or you just want to take it off-road. It came with the options of 2-door or 4-door. The feature that came out 
            with the 90's model was a rear-wheel anti-lock braking system, along with a new electronic speedomoter. In their time they were tough and dependable trucks/SUVs.

            <h2>Blazers during the 2000's</h2>
        <h3>Blazers during the early 2000's were aging and not as sought after. All models came with a 4.3L v6 engine which was considered powerful
            for its time. It was still available in a 2-door or 4-door. It came in 3 different Trim level packages. It came in the LS package which was just
            the base model. It came in the Xtreme package which was their lowered sporty version. It also came in the LS ZR2 package which was their off-road
            package that came with underbody skid plates and enhanced off-road performance.
